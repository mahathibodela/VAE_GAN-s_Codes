## GAN

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through adversarial processes. The generator creates synthetic data, while the discriminator attempts to differentiate between real and generated data.

## VAE

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a type of generative model that produce high-quality data similar to the data they are trained on. VAEs learn to encode input data into a latent space and then decode this latent representation back into the original data space. This approach allows VAEs to generate new, unseen data by sampling from the latent space.
